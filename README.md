PyCity Schools Analysis

-Analyzation of schools and grades based on various factors. Schools have been analyzed by district, school, school type, grade, and school size.

-Charter schools seem to have the highest percentage of students overall passing between both reading and math. District schools seem to have a lower overall passing rate, despite most of them having a larger overall budget.

-The relation between the spending range per student and the overall passing rate was surprising as schools that spend more per student seemed to have a lower overall passing rate. Schools that spent <$585 per student had the largest overall passing rate. Due to this, we're led to believe that the amount of funds spent per student may not have as large of an affect on the passing rate than we'd think.

-Medium (1000-2000) and Small (<1000) schools seemed to have a higher overall passing rate than Large (2000-5000) schools. We can estimate that schools with less students will see better testing results. It's possible that there's other factors in play such as the ratio of teachers vs students, but in this case, the data shows that medium and smaller schools have better performance.
